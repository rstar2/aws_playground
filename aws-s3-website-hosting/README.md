# Create serverless project
```
$ sls create -t hello-world -n my-ru-mladost.life
```
The template 'hello-world' is irrelevant it's not gonna be a Lambda function - so delete the handler.js


##. Fix serverless.yml
1. Delete functions tag
2. Create a AWS::S3::Bucket Resource named 'Website' (whatever name)
  - For S3 site hosting, the AccessControl property must be set to PublicRead.
  - The WebsiteConfiguration is where we define the 'index.html' for the site
  - Typically, you donâ€™t need to name a bucket because the CloudFormation
   generated bucket name will do but that is not the case here,
   but it will be used in configuring the AWS::Route53, so name it.
   (For the Route53 Alias record the S3 bucket name and DNS record name)
  - Grant access to the static content, we attach a permissive bucket policy
    - add access-control -> AccessControl: PublicRead
    - add proper bucket policy -> WebsiteS3BucketPolicy ...

3. Use 'serverless-s3-sync' plugin
  - Install
```
$ sls plugin install -n serverless-s3-sync
```
  - Configure it:
    - the bucket name where to sync
    - the local folder to sync (./website in this case)

4. Configure CloudFront to serve it out globally and to also that would let us handle SSL certs
