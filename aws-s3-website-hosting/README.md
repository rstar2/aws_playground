# Create serverless project
```
$ sls create -t hello-world -n my-website-mladost.life
```
The template 'hello-world' is irrelevant it's not gonna be a Lambda function - so delete the handler.js

##. Fix serverless.yml
1. Delete functions tag
2. Create a AWS::S3::Bucket Resource named 'Website' (whatever name)
  - For S3 site hosting, the AccessControl property must be set to PublicRead.
  - The WebsiteConfiguration is where we define the 'index.html' for the site
  - Typically, you donâ€™t need to name a bucket because the CloudFormation
   generated bucket name will do but that is not the case here,
   but it will be used in configuring the AWS::Route53, so name it.
   (For the Route53 Alias record the S3 bucket name and DNS record name)
  - Grant access to the static content, we attach a permissive bucket policy
    - add access-control -> AccessControl: PublicRead
    - add proper bucket policy -> WebsiteS3BucketPolicy ...

3. Use 'serverless-s3-sync' plugin
  - Install
```
$ sls plugin install -n serverless-s3-sync
```
  - Configure it:
    - the bucket name where to sync
    - the local folder to sync (./website in this case)

4. Configure CloudFront to serve it out globally and to also that would let us handle SSL certs

5. Configure Route53 Record
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-route53-aliastarget.html
https://github.com/ServerlessOpsIO/serverless-zombo.com/blob/master/serverless.yml

After that the NS servers of the created Route53 HostZone have to be set in the domain registrar (e.g. GoDaddy):
For instance:
ns-1328.awsdns-38.org.
ns-485.awsdns-60.com.
ns-1574.awsdns-04.co.uk.
ns-824.awsdns-39.net.

6. Configure proper SSL Certificate
TODO:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwgB_sIhIko
If using the site just through CloudFront domain we can use it's SSL Certificate,
but when a custom domain ("mladost.life") is in front with Route53 it must be set explicitly

## Deploy
```
$ sls deploy -v
```

## Test
Got to: http://<bucket-name>.s3-website-<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com

In this case:
```
$ sls info -v
```
Stack Outputs:
Region: us-east-1
ServerlessDeploymentBucketName: my-website-mladostlife-d-serverlessdeploymentbuck-1j88d5j7dhe14
WebsiteS3BucketName: my-website-mladost.life-dev
WebsiteS3DomainName: my-website-mladost.life-dev.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
WebsiteCDNDomainName: d1mmkrx8b90fl8.cloudfront.net

So website should be accessible on:
- http://my-website-mladost.life-dev.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
- http://d1mmkrx8b90fl8.cloudfront.net
- http://mladost.life      - could take some time (an hour or so) after entering the Route53 NS servers in the domain registrar (e.g. GoDaddy)
- http://www.mladost.life  - could take some time (an hour or so) after entering the Route53 NS servers in the domain registrar (e.g. GoDaddy)
